# DiceInvaders

Dice Invaders is a clone of the original Space Invders. It was an assignment as a part of DICE interview process.
Everything has been written from scratch, and no third-party library is used, to make it simpler for the reviewers to better evaluate my skills.
The game consists of two main parts:
- Engine
- Game

The main focus was on the good high-level design and performance of the engine, sacrifising the gamplay programming simplicity a bit. The algorithms and data layout used, are suitable for current scope of the problem. Changing the scope results in a new problem, requring new solutions.

TODO: add a rough architecture and usage documentation of the engine

# DiceInvaders

Dice Invaders is a clone of the original Space Invders. It was an assignment as a part of DICE interview process.
Everything has been written from scratch, and no third-party library is used, to make it simpler for the reviewers to better evaluate my skills.
The game consists of two main parts:
- Engine
- Game

The main focus was on the good high-level design and performance of the engine, sacrifising the gamplay programming simplicity a bit. The algorithms and data layout used, are suitable for current scope of the problem. Changing the scope results in a new problem, requring new solutions.

# Building
The project should build usign recent versions of Visual Studio (testet with VS2015). The resulting binary will be placed in the bin folder.
The working directory should be set to the "\bin| folder instead of the default project's root.
